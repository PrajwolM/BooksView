Review for IT Books
I have applied JavaScript on the following parts:

1. Collapsible in about.php

2. Modal for Adding Review.

3. Navbar Toggle in Assignment1\assignment1_2.

I have copied all the filed in assignment1_1 to assignment1_2 and setup css differently here.

Both assignment1_1 and assignment1_2 contains the bookreview.sql exported after working on it and are the same.

So there are two website here with different css in the zip folder:

1. assignment1/assignment1_1

2. assignment1/assignment1_2
